# Cintel-05-Cintel: Continuous Intelligence - Live Data Stream & User Interaction

## Overview

The **Continuous Intelligence** project is a web application built using **PyShiny** to display live data streams. This application allows users to interact with real-time data and visualize trends as data is processed in motion. The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate the power of **continuous intelligence (CI)** by utilizing live data feeds and enabling user interactions.

The application processes data streams, such as real-time metrics or sensor readings, and updates the visualizations dynamically. Users can interact with the data through a simple, user-friendly interface and adjust parameters in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Streams**: Displays live data updates as they are received, simulating real-world streaming data scenarios.
- **User Interaction**: Interactive elements allow users to modify the data or parameters, and see the effects immediately.
- **Live Data Visualization**: Graphical plots that update continuously with incoming data, showing trends, averages, and other statistical metrics.
- **Statistical Insights**: Displays key statistics, such as averages, maximums, and minimums, for better understanding of the data.
- **Deque Management**: Uses Pythonâ€™s **deque** data structure to handle and process recent data efficiently.
